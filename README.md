🥂 Liquid Delivery – The Old Man and His Liquid Dreams
A creative web design concept crafted in Figma for the #Include<web> Design Challenge.
🌙 Story
In a quiet little town lived an old man named Mr. Desai, who dreamt of a floating tavern in the clouds — where bottles of rum, whiskey, wine, and beer told stories of laughter, warmth, and memories.
That dream inspired Liquid Delivery — a design that celebrates emotion, nostalgia, and storytelling through visual design.

💡 Reflection
This project reminded me that design isn’t just about how things look — it’s about how they feel.
